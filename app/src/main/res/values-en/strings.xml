    <string name="sobre_texto">Every Sunday school (EBD) should be organized, structured, among many other things. In addition, one of the basic functions that a EBD must have is to collect the information needed to generate the general report for that day of school. Sunday School was developed in order to facilitate the creation and storage of this information, analyzed and collected by the responsible secretary. The ease of application usage causes anyone to be able to use it! You, secretary of Sunday school, can feel the impact of using Sunday School, improving their storage form of this data.</string>

    <string name="como_utilizar_texto">Use of the Sunday School to create the EBD report is simple and easy. Initially you need to perform the registration of at least one room (class) class. Otherwise, the option to create a report is unavailable. Upon registration of classes of EBD, you can generate the day of the report, where the current date is automatically entered. Once created the day of the report, you can not change it. You will be redirected to the new report screen, which will be selected the room, and told the amount of data present students, visitors and bibles of each class. Add the registry and this information will be part of the day of the report. Do not worry about performing manual calculation for the end of the report, the Sunday School does it for you! By clicking the end you will be taken to the list of reports made which contained the calculation of total students and Bibles of all EBD and can also be viewed in detail.</string>
